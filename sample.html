        <p style=>Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in
            hot ashes,
            or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked. Heat is
            gradually
            transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their center. As heat travels through, it
            transforms
            batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center"</p>

        <p style="color:brown;">Because of historical social and familial roles, baking has traditionally been performed
            at home by women for
            day-to-day meals and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption.When production was
            industrialized, baking was automated
            by machines in large factories. The art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for
            nutrition, as baked goods, especially
            breads, are a common and important food, both from an economic and cultural point of view. A person who
            prepares baked goods as a profession
            is called a baker. On a related note, a pastry chef is someone who is trained in the art of making pastries,
            desserts, bread and other baked goods.</p>
