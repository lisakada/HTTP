    This exercise is about making lists
</head>
<body>
    <div><br>Here's what I like about lists:</div> 
<ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>

    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
</ul>
<div>When you make a list, do it in this order:</div>
<ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>if it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</dl>
        <ol>
            <li>Curveball!! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
</ol>
